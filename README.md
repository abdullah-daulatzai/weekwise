# WeekWise
Welcome to the WeekWise README! This guide will walk you through everything you need to get started with the app.

## Overview
WeekWise is a productivity app focused on personal finance management and health tracking. It helps users monitor their daily expenses and identify patterns in their spending habits over time. The app features a unique financial analysis tool, inspired by a TED talk from a finance expert, who assisted people in becoming more aware of their unnecessary spending by analysing their habits over a six-month period. WeekWise demonstrates how small, seemingly insignificant purchases, such as energy drinks, can accumulate into substantial amounts over time, helping users make more informed financial decisions.

Future updates will include additional features, such as calorie tracking and step-counting, to further enhance your productivity and health awareness.

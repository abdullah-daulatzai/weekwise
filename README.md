# WeekWise
Welcome to the WeekWise README! This guide will walk you through everything you need to get started with the app.

## Overview
The Covid-19 Tracker is an app that gives you a quick look at the Covid-19 numbers around the world. It shows how many people have caught the virus, how many have died, and how many have recovered, using data from a public API. The app also has charts to help you see the impact of the pandemic, including how many people have been affected and the death rate. This helps users stay updated with the latest Covid-19 information worldwide.

The app gets real-time data from a free, publicly available API and is designed to be a simple tool for anyone who wants to follow the progress of the pandemic.

Future updates will include additional features, such as calorie tracking and step-counting, to further enhance your productivity and health awareness.

## How It Works

### Financial Analysis
The financial analysis tool works by storing and processing user input in the database. The system then tracks expenses and generates reports to show users how much they have spent on each category. Over time, the app identifies recurring purchases and helps users pinpoint where they can cut back.
For example, if a user spends money frequently on energy drinks during periods of fatigue, WeekWise will highlight this habit and show the total amount spent over time. This helps users become more conscious of their spending behavior and encourages smarter financial decisions.


## Future Improvements

* Expand financial analysis features: Provide more granular reports on specific categories of spending.
* Calorie tracking enhancements: Automatically calculate calories based on common food items.
* Step counting optimization: Integrate with wearables to track steps automatically.
* Improved visualization: Add more data visualization to make reports easier to understand.

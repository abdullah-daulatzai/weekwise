# WeekWise
Welcome to the WeekWise README! This guide will walk you through everything you need to get started with the app.

## Overview
WeekWise is a productivity app focused on personal finance management and health tracking. It helps users monitor their daily expenses and identify patterns in their spending habits over time. The app features a unique financial analysis tool, inspired by a TED talk from a finance expert, who assisted people in becoming more aware of their unnecessary spending by analysing their habits over a six-month period. WeekWise demonstrates how small, seemingly insignificant purchases, such as energy drinks, can accumulate into substantial amounts over time, helping users make more informed financial decisions.

Future updates will include additional features, such as calorie tracking and step-counting, to further enhance your productivity and health awareness.

## How It Works

### Financial Analysis
The financial analysis tool works by storing and processing user input in the database. The system then tracks expenses and generates reports to show users how much they have spent on each category. Over time, the app identifies recurring purchases and helps users pinpoint where they can cut back.
For example, if a user spends money frequently on energy drinks during periods of fatigue, WeekWise will highlight this habit and show the total amount spent over time. This helps users become more conscious of their spending behavior and encourages smarter financial decisions.


## Future Improvements

* Calorie tracking enhancements: Automatically calculate calories based on common food items.
* Step counting optimization: Integrate with wearables to track steps automatically.
* Improved visualization: Add more data visualization to make reports easier to understand.
